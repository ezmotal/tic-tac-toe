How to Play

The game starts with Player O by default.

Players take turns clicking on an empty box to place their symbol (O or X).

The game checks for a winner after every move:

If a player gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), they win.

If all boxes are filled and no player wins, the game ends in a draw.

A message is displayed when there is a winner or a draw.

Click New Game or Restart Game to play again.
